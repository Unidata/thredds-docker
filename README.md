# THREDDS Docker

[![Travis Status](https://travis-ci.org/Unidata/thredds-docker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Unidata/thredds-docker)

A containerized [THREDDS Data Server](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/tds/) containing a full-featured Tomcat (SSL over APR, etc.). This project was initially developed by [Axiom Data Science](http://www.axiomdatascience.com/) and now lives at Unidata.

Available major versions:

* `unidata/tds` (currently `4.6.6`)
* `unidata/tds:latest` (currently `4.6.6`)
* `unidata/tds:4.6` (currently `4.6.6`)
* `unidata/tds:5.0.0-SNAPSHOT` (currently `5.0.0-20160708.184540-12`)

Specific releases:

* `unidata/tds:5.0.0-20160708.184540-12`
* `unidata/tds:4.6.6`
* `unidata/tds:4.6.5`

## tl;dr

**Quickstart**

    docker-compose up -d thredds-quickstart
## Building the THREDDS Container

To build the THREDDS Docker container:

    docker build -t unidata/tds:<version> .

It is best to be on a fast network when building containers as there can be many intermediate layers to download.

## `docker-compose`

To run the THREDDS Docker container, beyond a basic Docker setup, we recommend installing [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

## Production

### Configuration

First, define directory and file paths for log files, SSL, Tomcat, THREDDS, and data in [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) for the `thredds-production` image. Then:

### Memory

Tomcat web applications and the TDS can require large amounts of memory to run. This container is setup to run Tomcat with a [4 gigabyte memory allocation](files/javaopts.sh). When running this container, ensure your VM or hardware can accommodate this memory requirement.


### Running the TDS

Once you have completed your setup you can run the container with:

    docker-compose up -d thredds-production

The output of such command should be something like:

    Creating thredds

### Stopping the TDS

To stop this container:

    docker-compose stop

### Delete TDS Container

To clean the slate and remove the container (not the image, the container):

    docker-compose rm -f

## More on Configuration
### Tomcat

See [these instructions](https://github.com/axiom-data-science/docker-tomcat) for configuring Tomcat

### THREDDS

To mount your own `content/thredds` directory with `docker-compose.yml`:

```
  volumes:
    - /path/to/your/thredds/directory:/opt/tomcat/content/thredds
```

If you just want to change a few files, you can mount them individually. Please
note that the **THREDDS cache is stored in the content directory**. If you choose
to mount individual files, you should also mount a cache directory.

```
  volumes:
    - /path/to/your/tomcat/logs/:/opt/tomcat/logs/
    - /path/to/your/thredds/logs/:/opt/tomcat/content/thredds/logs/
    - /path/to/your/ssl.crt:/opt/tomcat/conf/ssl.crt
    - /path/to/your/ssl.key:/opt/tomcat/conf/ssl.key
    - /path/to/your/tomcat-users.xml:/opt/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml
    - /path/to/your/thredds/directory:/opt/tomcat/content/thredds
    - /path/to/your/data/directory1:/path/to/your/data/directory1 
    - /path/to/your/data/directory2:/path/to/your/data/directory2
```

* `threddsConfig.xml` - the THREDDS configuration file (comments are in-line in the file)
* `wmsConfig.xml` - the ncWMS configuration file
* `catalog.xml` - the root catalog THREDDS loads

### Users

By default, Tomcat will start with [two user accounts](https://github.com/Unidata/thredds-docker/blob/master/files/tomcat-users.xml). The passwords are equal to the user name.

* `tdm` - used by the THREDDS Data Manager for connecting to THREDDS
* `admin` - can be used by everything else (has full privileges)

### Use Case

 Let's say you want to upgrade to the Docker THREDDS Container, and you already have a TDS configured with
 * Directory containing TDS configuration files (e.g. `threddsConfig.xml`, `wmsConfig.xml` and THREDDS catalog `.xml` files) in `/opt/tomcat/content/thredds`
 * Folders containing NetCDF and other data files read by the TDS in `/data1` and `/data2`
 * Tomcat users configured in `/opt/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml`
 * SSL certificate at `/opt/tomcat/ssl.crt` and SSL key at `/opt/tomcat/ssl.key`
 * Running on ports 8090 and 8453 (ssl)
 
Then you could issue this command to fire up the new Docker TDS container (remember to stop the old TDS first):

    docker-compose stop thredds-production
    docker-compose up -d thredds-production

## Volume Permission Caveats

There are occasionally permission problems with the container not being able to write to externally mounted directories on the Docker host. Unfortunately, [the best practices in this area are still being worked out](https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/46ec3t/volume_permissions_best_practices/?), and this can be the source of frustration with the user and group Unix IDs not matching inside versus outside the container. These scenarios can lead to big "permission denied" headaches. One, non-ideal, solution is to open up Unix file permissions for externally mounted directories.

    chmod -R 777 <externally mounted directory>

## Check What is Running

### curl

At this point you should be able to do:

    curl localhost:80/thredds/catalog.html
    # or whatever port you mapped to outside the container in the docker-compose.yml

and get back a response that looks something like

    <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC '-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN'
            'http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd'>
    <html>
    <head>
    <meta http-equiv='Content-Type' content='text/html; charset=UTF-8'><title>TdsStaticCatalog http://localhost/thredds/catalog.html</title>
    <link rel='stylesheet' href='/thredds/tdsCat.css' type='text/css' >
    </head>
    ...
    </html>

### docker ps

If you encounter a problem there, you can also:

    docker ps

which should give you output that looks something like this:

    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                                                 NAMES
    6c256c50a6cf        unidata/tds:latest   "/entrypoint.sh catal"   6 minutes ago       Up 6 minutes        0.0.0.0:8443->8443/tcp, 0.0.0.0:80->8080/tcp, 0.0.0.0:443->8443/tcp   threddsdocker_thredds-quickstart_1

to obtain the ID of the running TDS container. Now you can enter the container with:

    docker exec -it <ID> bash

Now use `curl` **inside** the container to verify the TDS is running:

    curl localhost:8080/thredds/catalog.html

you should get a response that looks something like:

    <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC '-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN'
            'http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd'>
    <html>
    <head>
    <meta http-equiv='Content-Type' content='text/html; charset=UTF-8'><title>TdsStaticCatalog http://localhost/thredds/catalog.html</title>
    <link rel='stylesheet' href='/thredds/tdsCat.css' type='text/css' >
    </head>
    ...
    </html>

## Connecting to TDS with a Web Browser

At this point we are done setting up the TDS with docker. To navigate to this instance of TDS from the web, you will have to ensure your docker host (e.g., a cloud VM at Amazon or Microsoft Azure) allows Internet traffic through port 80 at whatever IP or domain name your docker host is located.

## TDM

The TDM is an application that works in conjunction with the TDS. It creates indexes for GRIB data in a background process, and notifies the TDS via port 8443 when data have been updated or changed. See [here](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/tds/reference/collections/TDM.html) to learn more about the TDM. 

Available versions:

* `unidata/tdm` (currently `4.6`)
* `unidata/tdm:latest` (currently `4.6`)
* `unidata/tdm:4.6`

### Configuration

When the TDM informs TDS concerning data changes, it will communicate via the `tdm` tomcat user. Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file and change the `TDM_PW` to [TDM password](https://github.com/axiom-data-science/docker-tomcat#users). Also ensure `TDS_HOST` is pointing to the correct THREDDS host.

### Running the TDM

    docker-compose up -d tdm

### Building the TDM Container

To build the TDM Docker container:

    docker build -f Dockerfile.tdm -t unidata/tdm:<version> .

### Capturing TDM Log Files Outside the Container

Until `5.0`, the TDM lacks configurability with respect to the location of log files and the TDM simply logs locally to where the TDM is invoked. In the meantime, to capture TDM log files outside the container, do the usual volume mounting outside the container:

    /path/to/your/tdm/logs:/opt/tomcat/content/tdm/

*and* put the `tdm.jar` and `tdm.sh` run script in `/path/to/your/tdm/logs`.

For example, you can get the `tdm.jar`:

    curl -SL ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/thredds/4.6/4.6.6/tdm-4.6.jar -o tdm-4.6.jar

The `tdm.sh` script can be found within this repository. Make sure the `tdm.sh` script is executable by the container.
